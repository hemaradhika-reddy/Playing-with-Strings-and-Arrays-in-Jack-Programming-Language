# Playing-with-Strings-and-Arrays-in-Jack-Programming-Language
Introduction
The course Nand to Tetris allowed us to understand how computers work by providing us with the Nand to Tetris toolset, essential for building a simple computer. This toolset includes a programming language named Jack Programming Language, which opens up possibilities for small projects as part of the Nand to Tetris course. To explore this language in-depth and discover more possibilities for using arrays and strings, we delved into the world of Jack.

To fully understand the limits of the language and the peculiarities of its inbuilt classes, we set out to recreate a few inbuilt classes for arrays and strings. As we explored this programming language, one of the fundamental challenges was implementing the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Additionally, we attempted to implement a data structure named a Queue using arrays.
